# AI-Powered OCR & Translator

## Overview
This AI-powered application extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and translates it into multiple languages using deep learning models. The system provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload images, crop selected text areas, and translate extracted text instantly.

## Features
- **Upload Images**: Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats.
- **Crop Image**: Select a specific text area for OCR processing.
- **OCR Extraction**: Uses Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
- **Multi-language Translation**: Translate extracted text into various languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and Marathi.
- **Streamlit UI**: Responsive and visually appealing interface.
